### CSA Data Analysis and Business Intelligence Project: Project Goals & Context

Our organization conducts an annual giving campaign called the **Catholic Sharing Appeal (CSA)**. The goal of the CSA is to encourage parishioners to pledge and contribute financially beyond their regular offertory, directly supporting the initiatives and operational efforts of our Bishop and Pastoral Center. The CSA is managed by our Director of Development.

We use **Ministry Platform (MP)** as our primary database for tracking all CSA-related data. Relevant tables in MP include:
	* 	**Contacts**
	* 	**Donors**
	* 	**Donations**
	* 	**Donation Distributions** (money distribution to CSA programs by congregation)
	* 	**Programs**
	* 	**Pledge Campaigns**
	* 	**Pledges**
	* 	**Congregations**

Each of these tables includes subtables for additional data support and relational clarity.

Currently, Ministry Platform alone is insufficient for the sophisticated business intelligence and data analysis we require. To effectively analyze campaign performance, donor behavior, pledge fulfillment, and financial distribution, we will create a dedicated analytics solution.

Our desired technology stack for this project is:
	* 	**Ministry Platform API** (data source)
	* 	**n8n** (automation and integration)
	* 	**Supabase** (secure data storage and querying)
	* 	**OpenAI API** (intuitive and dynamic data querying assistance)

### Primary Goals for the Project:
	1.	Extract relevant CSA data seamlessly from Ministry Platform.
	2.	Automate data pipelines efficiently and reliably with n8n.
	3.	Securely store and manage the extracted data within Supabase.
	4.	Leverage OpenAI’s API for natural language querying and advanced insights generation.
	5.	Produce actionable, clearly documented insights to guide our Director of Development and diocesan leadership in strategic decision-making.
	6.	Maintain compliance and data privacy throughout the entire process.

**Your task as a RoleBot:**
Keep these overarching goals in mind when performing your assigned role. Each action, recommendation, or deliverable should directly support or align with these project goals, ensuring clarity, effectiveness, compliance, and strategic value throughout the entire CSA data analytics initiative.
