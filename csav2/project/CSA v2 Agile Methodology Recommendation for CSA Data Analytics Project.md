# CSA v2 Agile Methodology Recommendation for CSA Data Analytics Project

From: Agile Coach

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Scrum-Kanban Framework

Based on your CSA Data Analytics project involving integrations between Ministry Platform, n8n, Supabase, and OpenAI, I recommend a hybrid Scrum-Kanban approach. This methodology will provide the structure needed for coordinated development while maintaining flexibility for technical exploration and integration challenges.

## Why This Approach Works for Your Project

1. **Integration-focused work** benefits from visual workflow management (Kanban)
2. **Cross-functional coordination** is supported by regular Scrum ceremonies
3. **Technical uncertainty** in API integrations requires adaptive planning
4. **Incremental value delivery** aligns with your stakeholder expectations

## Sprint Structure and Cadence

### Recommended Sprint Cycle: 2-Week Sprints

**Sprint Breakdown:**
- **Days 1-2:** Planning and refinement
- **Days 3-9:** Development and integration
- **Day 10:** Internal testing and review
- **Last Day:** Demo, retrospective, and planning preparation

**Key Advantages of 2-Week Sprints for Your Project:**
- Short enough to adapt quickly to integration challenges
- Long enough to complete meaningful integration work
- Provides regular touchpoints with the Director of Development
- Allows for frequent reprioritization based on technical findings

## Team Structure and Roles

### Core Team Roles

1. **Product Owner**
   - Likely role for: Director of Development
   - Responsibilities:
     - Prioritize features based on stakeholder value
     - Define acceptance criteria for integrations
     - Make decisions on trade-offs
     - Approve completed work

2. **Scrum Master / Agile Coach**
   - Responsibilities:
     - Facilitate ceremonies and remove impediments
     - Coach the team on agile practices
     - Manage dependencies between integration components
     - Track and communicate progress

3. **Development Team Members**
   - Recommended composition:
     - **API Integration Specialist** (Ministry Platform expertise)
     - **Automation Engineer** (n8n workflows)
     - **Database Engineer** (Supabase implementation)
     - **AI Integration Developer** (OpenAI implementation)
     - **Full-Stack Developer** (User interfaces and dashboards)
     - **QA Specialist** (Testing integrations and data quality)

4. **Technical SMEs** (Part-time/as needed)
   - Ministry Platform Administrator
   - Data Governance Specialist
   - Security/Compliance Advisor

## Workflow Management

### Kanban Board Structure

**Recommended Columns:**
1. **Backlog** - Prioritized but not yet ready for development
2. **Ready** - Refined and ready for the next sprint
3. **In Development** - Currently being worked on
4. **Integration Testing** - Verifying component interactions
5. **QA** - Formal quality assurance
6. **Ready for Review** - Awaiting stakeholder approval
7. **Done** - Completed and accepted

**Swimlanes by Integration Component:**
- Ministry Platform API Extraction
- n8n Workflow Automation
- Supabase Data Storage
- OpenAI Integration
- User Interface/Reporting

## Key Ceremonies

### 1. Sprint Planning (2 hours)
- Review and commit to sprint backlog
- Break down integration work into tasks
- Identify dependencies between components
- Set clear sprint goals focused on working integrations

### 2. Daily Standup (15 minutes)
- Focus on integration progress and blockers
- Address cross-component dependencies
- Coordinate testing needs

### 3. Backlog Refinement (1 hour, mid-sprint)
- Prepare stories for future sprints
- Clarify technical requirements for integrations
- Estimate complexity of upcoming work

### 4. Sprint Review/Demo (1 hour)
- Demonstrate working integrations to stakeholders
- Gather feedback on data quality and insights
- Validate that integrations meet business needs

### 5. Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)
- Reflect on integration challenges
- Identify process improvements
- Celebrate integration milestones

## Metrics and Visibility

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Velocity** - Story points completed per sprint
2. **Cycle Time** - Time from start to completion for integration components
3. **Defect Rate** - Issues found in integrations post-acceptance
4. **Data Quality Metrics** - Accuracy and completeness of data flows

### Visualization Tools

- **Sprint Burndown Chart** - Track progress within sprints
- **Cumulative Flow Diagram** - Identify bottlenecks in the integration process
- **Integration Dependency Map** - Visualize connections between components

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Agile Setup (1-2 Weeks)
- Establish team roles and responsibilities
- Set up Kanban board and workflow
- Create initial backlog and prioritize
- Conduct team training on the hybrid approach

### Phase 2: Initial Sprints (Sprints 1-3)
- Focus on foundational integrations
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for frequent testing
- Implement automated testing for data flows
- Deliver initial working integration proof-of-concept

### Phase 3: Refinement (Ongoing)
- Adjust process based on retrospective feedback
- Scale complexity of integrations
- Increase automation of testing
- Enhance metrics and reporting

## Recommendations for Success

1. **Start with a Walking Skeleton** - Create an end-to-end integration with minimal functionality early
2. **Implement Feature Flags** - Allow for partial deployments and A/B testing
3. **Automate Integration Testing** - Ensure data flows correctly across all systems
4. **Create a Dedicated Integration Environment** - Separate from development and production
5. **Document API Contracts Early** - Establish clear interfaces between components
