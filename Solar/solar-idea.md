# 💡 Title: “Stewarding the Sun: A Lease-to-Own Solar Strategy for Our Diocese”

⸻

🟨 1. Mission-Driven Opportunity

Why Solar? Why Now?
	•	We’re called to be faithful stewards of God’s creation (Laudato Si’).
	•	Energy costs are rising—solar gives us a path to predictable savings.
	•	We can be leaders in environmental responsibility in our region.

“Living our mission includes how we power our parishes.”

⸻

🟦 2. What Is a Lease-to-Own Solar Strategy?

A Three-Phase Process:
	1.	Installation by a for-profit partner (could be a parishioner-owned coop).
	2.	Leasing the solar system at a fixed monthly rate for 7–15 years.
	3.	Ownership transferred to the Diocese/parish after the lease, or via early buyout.

Result: Long-term savings, energy independence, and mission alignment.

🟩 3. Why Lease-to-Own Instead of Just Buying or a PPA?
| Option        | Upfront Cost | Ownership  | Long-Term Savings | Maintenance |
|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Outright Buy  | High         | Yes        | Highest           | Ours        |
| PPA           | $0           | No         | Moderate          | Theirs      |
| Lease-to-Own  | $0 upfront   | Eventually | Significant       | Negotiable  |
Lease-to-own is the sweet spot:
	•	Avoids upfront capital costs.
	•	Builds long-term equity.
	•	Maintains control over site use and aesthetics.

🟧 4. The Parishioner-Owned Solar Cooperative

What if our parishioners helped power their churches?
	•	For-profit coop formed and funded by parishioners.
	•	Raises capital to install systems, receives lease revenue.
	•	Diocese benefits from lower costs; parishioners benefit from modest returns and spiritual satisfaction.

“An investment in our church, our planet, and each other.”

⸻

🟦 5. How It Works: Timeline and Financial Model

Sample Lease Terms (Per Site):
	•	Term: 10–15 years
	•	Monthly Lease: $X (10–20% below current utility cost)
	•	Buyout Options: Year 7, Year 10, End of Term
	•	Ownership = ~75% reduction in energy costs after buyout

After Buyout:
	•	Only pay for maintenance (low)
	•	Power is “free” from the sun
	•	System lasts 25–30 years

⸻

🟨 6. Benefits by Stakeholder

Diocese & Parishes
	•	Predictable energy costs
	•	Long-term savings
	•	No upfront debt or maintenance

Parishioners (Investors)
	•	Local impact
	•	Modest ROI
	•	Contribution to mission

Environment & Community
	•	Carbon reduction
	•	Witness to Catholic values
	•	Model for others to follow

⸻

🟥 7. Key Considerations & Risks
	•	Legal Structure: Must avoid UBIT, and ensure buyout terms are favorable.
	•	Financial Planning: Need to plan now for Year 7–10 buyout options.
	•	Parish Readiness: Not every site may be viable at the same time.
	•	Governance: Clear roles for Diocese, coop, and project manager.

⸻

🟩 8. Pilot Proposal

Start with 3–5 parishes representing:
	•	Geographic diversity
	•	Facility variation (schools, churches, admin)
	•	Strong donor/investor interest

Use pilot to:
	•	Refine contracts and technical process
	•	Demonstrate savings
	•	Build support

⸻

🟦 9. What We Need to Do Next
	1.	Identify legal counsel with nonprofit + energy experience.
	2.	Scope out 3–5 pilot properties for technical feasibility.
	3.	Begin conversations about coop formation and investor interest.
	4.	Draft lease and buyout models for approval.
	5.	Educate parish leadership on the opportunity.

⸻

🟨 10. Final Thought

“This is more than a sustainability project.
It’s an act of stewardship, solidarity, and witness.”

We don’t just want to save money.
We want to live our faith in how we power our parishes, our schools, and our communities.
