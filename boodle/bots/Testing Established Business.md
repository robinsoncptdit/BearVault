# Testing Established Business

**Prompt: “Let's say we created our MVP, received investor funding, created a production-ready SaaS, gained customers, improved the product, and now we are cruising with business as usual. Describe the company structure as it probably exists and then assign bots to be used by different departments. Don't use any bots who have outlived their earlier roles in building the company. Instead, focus on the use of day-to-day bots that should be used by each department.”**

Here’s a concise overview of your **Widgets SaaS company** at a stage of steady growth and operational stability, organized by departments, along with their corresponding day-to-day **RoleBots**. All startup-focused bots (such as Startup Advisor, Pitch Deck Designer, and Investor Pitch) have now fulfilled their initial purpose and thus won’t appear here.
