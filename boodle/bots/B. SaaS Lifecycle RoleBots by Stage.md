# B. SaaS Lifecycle RoleBots by Stage

**Prompt: “Okay, to test where we are with this list by creating a sample scenario. The goal of this will be to ask you about which bots we will need and what the best order would be. After that I will create a scenario within that scenario that has a theoretical problem for us to solve and you will then be asked to provide a new list of bots in order that best serves to solve that problem.**

**Example Scenario:**

**"I have an idea for a SaaS product we will call 'Widgets' that will help our user customer solve the business problems of X, Y, and Z."**

**Return the bots with your best answer after thinking about it.”**
