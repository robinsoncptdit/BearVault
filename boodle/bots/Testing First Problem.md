# Testing First Problem

**Prompt: Okay, now I have a problem. The investors would like to see a minimum viable product (MVP) before moving forward. What should we do with our bots?**

Given this new scenario—**“The investors want to see a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before proceeding”**—we’ll reorganize and simplify your RoleBots to focus specifically on quickly and effectively producing an MVP.

### Adjusted Bot Order for Quickly Building Your MVP:

**1. RoleBot Chief Innovation Officer (CIO)**
*Clearly defines the key differentiators and innovative core features to focus on.*

**2. RoleBot Business Analyst**
*Helps identify and document the minimal set of essential features that directly address customer problems X, Y, and Z.*

**3. RoleBot Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**
*Leads rapid development, decides on appropriate technologies, and ensures the MVP is technically achievable.*

**4. RoleBot Agile Coach**
*Facilitates agile methodology to rapidly iterate, manage sprints, and streamline delivery.*

**5. RoleBot Pitch Deck Designer**
*Creates an updated and compelling visual story showcasing the MVP’s value to investors.*

**6. RoleBot Investor Pitch**
*Adjusts messaging and prepares presentation to effectively demonstrate how the MVP solves core customer problems.*

⸻

**Next Steps:**
	* Quickly engage the **CIO** and **Business Analyst** to tightly define the MVP’s scope.
	* Get the **CTO** and **Agile Coach** immediately involved to accelerate MVP production.
	* Lastly, prepare for investor engagement using the **Pitch Deck Designer** and **Investor Pitch** bots to ensure clear communication of progress and value.

This approach ensures you rapidly deliver an MVP tailored precisely to investor expectations.
