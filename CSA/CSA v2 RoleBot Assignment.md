# CSA v2 RoleBot Assignment

Prompt: “I have a new project that I need a RoleBot list for. This is a very specific project as a one-off. 

In Ministry Platform, we have an annual giving campaign called the Catholic Sharing Appeal. The purpose of this campaign is to have parishioners pledge and give above and beyond their weekly offertory in order to support the Bishop's and Pastoral Center's efforts. The campaign is led by our Director of Development.

The following tables in Ministry Platform are used: Contacts, Donors, Donations, Donation Distributions (where money directs to programs for CSA arranged by congregation), Programs, Pledge Campaigns, Pledges, and Congregations. There are subtables that support these tables.

Our Director of Development would like to do some data analysis and business intelligence on this data in MP. MP is not the best suited for this task. I do not want to attempt this in Power BI. I'd prefer to take advantage of MP's API, use n8n for automation, Supabase for data pulled from MP as a data store, and OpenAI's API for assistance with querying the data.

Your goal right now is to just list the needed RoleBots in the best order to achieve success. I will ask those bots to fulfill their tasks from project start to project finish. For each bot, please create what you think would be the best prompts to use with that bot.”
