# MP2AI Answers to Questions it raised
Answer for "4  Questions that would tilt the decision" are:
1. I believe the timeline should be as fast as possible. Some sort of MVP within in a month that focuses on only one user persona for example. I am meeting with ACST a month from now to discuss roadmaps. For funding, I am hoping for either 1 of 2 possibilities: 1) seed funding from ACST to move from MVP to actual product (Route A, not NP), or 2) a non-profit joint venture between the Diocese of Pensacola-Tallahassee and ACST to fund. If neither materializes, the onus would be on my IT team and any 1099s we would need. There are tools we could use such as Cursor or Windsurf under the hopeful notion of the Pareto Principal of having those IDEs create 80% of the code and then using IT/1099s for the remaining 20%.
2. Parish staff are currently stuck in the situation we are in so any positive change would be welcomed. There will be no blackout but we will beta test the buildout with seasoned MP users we do have with the goal of quickly producing an MVP and then iterating until production.
3. Yes, I have the full trust and confidence of ACST
4. Internally we only have 1 person (me) that could be considered the FTE engineer but I would not be available for enough hours. Again, we may have to rely on Cursor or Windsurf (etc) for a lot of the framing and initial code and then 1099s or vendors to finish/polish/bug squash.
5. That is an interesting question. I have build a strong relationship with ACST over the past 6 years under contract and over the past 16 years with the founders. However, C-Suite has heard complaints from parish users about MP and have come to their own biases against MP. These complaints are at the core of why we would like to build out a better learning and knowledge system. We want our users to succeed and complain less to C-Suite who could then probably be won over, especially if progress is being made on the entirety of MP (the platform, learning how to use it, data quality, business intelligence).
