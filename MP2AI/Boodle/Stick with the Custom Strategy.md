# Stick with the Custom Strategy

# Startup Advisor Response: Custom Solution Strategy for Parish User Personas

Thank you for clarifying your direction, Chuck. Focusing on a custom solution makes sense given the consistent user personas across your parishes. Let me outline a strategic approach for developing this custom solution.

## Custom Solution Framework

### 1. Architecture Design

I recommend a modular architecture with these core components:

- **Knowledge Repository**: A structured database to store and categorize content
- **Retrieval Engine**: To find relevant content based on user queries and context
- **Persona Management System**: To map users to appropriate content paths
- **Interface Layer**: Multiple access points based on user preferences

### 2. Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Content Organization & Taxonomy
- Create a detailed mapping of parish personas to Ministry Platform features
- Develop a tagging system for content (by persona, task complexity, frequency)
- Design knowledge schemas that accommodate both procedural and conceptual content
- Establish content quality standards and templates

#### Phase 2: Core Engine Development
- Build the retrieval system using vector embeddings for semantic search
- Implement the persona identification and content filtering logic
- Develop the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) component for Q&A capabilities
- Create content maintenance workflows for updates

#### Phase 3: Interface Development
- Start with a simple web interface accessible to all parish staff
- Add contextual help capabilities within Ministry Platform if possible
- Develop integration with your support ticketing system
- Create onboarding pathways for each persona

## Technology Stack Recommendations

For a cost-effective yet scalable solution:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI or Node.js
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant (open-source) or Pinecone (managed service)
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage Azure OpenAI Service (since you're in the Microsoft ecosystem)
- **Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for documents, Azure SQL for metadata
- **Frontend**: React or Next.js for web interfaces
- **Authentication**: Integrate with your existing Microsoft authentication

## Implementation Strategy

### Start Small but Scalable
1. Begin with one high-impact persona (perhaps parish administrator)
2. Focus on the most common tasks and pain points
3. Build a minimal viable product that demonstrates clear value
4. Gather feedback and iterate before expanding to other personas

### Leverage Existing Resources
- Use Microsoft Power Automate for content scraping and processing
- Implement SharePoint as your initial content repository
- Consider using Microsoft Fabric for analytics on usage patterns

### Knowledge Acquisition Approach
1. **Automated Scraping**: Use tools like Playwright or Puppeteer to extract content from ACST's knowledge base
2. **Manual Enhancement**: Supplement with parish-specific context and workflows
3. **User Contribution**: Create mechanisms for parish staff to contribute their own tips and workflows

## Cost Considerations

To keep this budget-friendly:
- Utilize open-source components where possible
- Leverage your existing Microsoft licenses
- Consider a serverless architecture to minimize infrastructure costs
- Implement a phased rollout to spread development costs

## Measuring Success

Define clear metrics to evaluate the impact:
- Reduction in support tickets related to Ministry Platform
- Decreased onboarding time for new parish staff
- Improved confidence scores in using Ministry Platform features
- Time saved on common administrative tasks

## Next Steps Question

Would you like to start by mapping out the specific needs and common tasks for one key persona (like parish administrator), or would you prefer to begin with the technical architecture and data extraction strategy? Understanding your preferred starting point will help us develop a more detailed implementation plan.
