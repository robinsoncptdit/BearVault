## Risk Management Approach

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Content extraction challenges | Start with manual processing of high-priority content while refining automation |
| User adoption resistance | Involve users early, focus on pain points, provide adequate training |
| Resource constraints | Implement phased approach, demonstrate value early to justify continued investment |
| ACST relationship concerns | Maintain transparent communication, explore formal partnership |
| Technical complexity | Use proven technologies, implement architecture reviews, consider external expertise |

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific phase or provide more detailed planning for a particular milestone? I can also develop a more detailed budget allocation or resource planning framework if that would be helpful.
