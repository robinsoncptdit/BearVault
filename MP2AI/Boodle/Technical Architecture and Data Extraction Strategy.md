# Technical Architecture and Data Extraction Strategy

***This is for the LARGE buildout***

Thank you for directing us to focus on the technical architecture and data extraction strategy first. This is a wise approach as it establishes the foundation for your persona-based knowledge system for Ministry Platform.

## Technical Architecture Overview

I recommend a modular, cloud-based architecture with these core components:

### 1. Data Layer
- **Content Repository**: Azure Blob Storage for raw documents and media
- **Vector Database**: Azure Cognitive Search with vector capabilities for semantic search
- **Metadata Store**: Azure SQL Database for structured information about content
- **User Profile Database**: To store persona mappings and learning progress

### 2. Application Layer
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: For ingestion, transformation, and enrichment
- **Retrieval Engine**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
- **Persona Management Service**: Maps users to content paths
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks usage patterns and effectiveness

### 3. Interface Layer
- **Web Portal**: Primary interface for all personas
- **API Gateway**: For integration with other systems (FreshService, etc.)
- **Embedded Widgets**: For contextual help within Ministry Platform
- **Notification System**: For learning path progression

### 4. Security Layer
- **Authentication**: Azure AD integration
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: For compliance and usage tracking

## Data Extraction Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Acquisition

#### 1. Web Scraping Implementation
- **Technology**: Python with Playwright or Selenium
- **Approach**:
  - Create authenticated sessions to access protected content
  - Implement respectful crawling patterns (rate limiting, honoring robots.txt)
  - Extract HTML content preserving structure and relationships
  - Download associated media and attachments
  - Map content hierarchy and navigation paths

#### 2. Content Processing Pipeline
- **Document Parsing**: Extract text from various formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX)
- **Content Chunking**: Break content into appropriate segments for retrieval
- **Metadata Extraction**: Identify titles, categories, dates, authors
- **Entity Recognition**: Identify Ministry Platform features, roles, processes
- **Relationship Mapping**: Connect related content pieces

#### 3. Quality Control
- **Validation Workflows**: Ensure extracted content is complete and accurate
- **Missing Content Detection**: Identify gaps in knowledge coverage
- **Duplication Detection**: Identify and merge redundant information
- **Version Control**: Track content changes over time

### Phase 2: Knowledge Enhancement

#### 1. Content Enrichment
- **Persona Tagging**: Associate content with relevant parish roles
- **Task Classification**: Tag by common workflows and processes
- **Complexity Scoring**: Rate content by expertise level required
- **Prerequisite Mapping**: Establish learning dependencies

#### 2. Content Transformation
- **Simplification**: Convert technical documentation to role-appropriate language
- **Contextual Enhancement**: Add parish-specific context to generic instructions
- **Visual Enhancement**: Create diagrams and screenshots for complex processes
- **Procedural Formatting**: Convert narrative text to step-by-step instructions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Month 1: Foundation
- Set up cloud infrastructure
- Develop initial scraping tools
- Create content storage schema
- Establish basic processing pipeline

### Month 2-3: Core Engine
- Implement vector embedding process
- Build basic retrieval system
- Develop persona classification logic
- Create simple web interface prototype

### Month 4-5: Enhancement
- Refine content processing
- Implement feedback mechanisms
- Develop analytics dashboard
- Begin persona-specific content paths

### Month 6: Integration
- Connect with support ticketing system
- Implement notification system
- Develop user progress tracking
- Launch initial version to select users

## Technical Considerations

### Data Refresh Strategy
- **Incremental Updates**: Regular checks for new/modified content
- **Change Detection**: Compare against previous versions
- **Scheduled Full Refreshes**: Periodic complete rebuilds to ensure consistency

### Scalability Approach
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment
- **Serverless Components**: Azure Functions for processing tasks
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed content
- **Load Balancing**: For handling concurrent users

### Cost Optimization
- **Tiered Storage**: Move less-accessed content to lower-cost storage
- **Compute Scaling**: Scale down during low-usage periods
- **Reserved Instances**: For predictable workloads
- **Resource Monitoring**: Identify and eliminate waste

## Next Steps

To move forward with this technical architecture and data extraction strategy, I recommend:

1. Conduct a small proof-of-concept scrape of a subset of the Ministry Platform knowledge base
2. Test the content processing pipeline with sample documents
3. Evaluate vector search effectiveness with common user queries
4. Develop a detailed technical specification document

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific component of this architecture or extraction strategy? Or would you prefer to discuss how we might approach the initial proof-of-concept?
