# IT Project Manager Review: 30-Day MVP Execution Plan

I've reviewed your 30-day MVP execution plan for the Ministry Platform knowledge management system. This is a well-structured, focused plan that aligns perfectly with creating a demonstrable MVP for ACST. Below is my assessment and recommendations.

## Overall Assessment

The plan is excellent for an MVP with:
- Clear scope (search box, top-10 list, chat widget, and micro-course)
- Realistic timeline (30 days)
- Appropriate resource allocation (Lead Engineer + Contract Developer)
- Well-defined daily tasks with ownership and hour estimates
- Focused on the Events & Groups Coordinator persona

## Strengths of the Plan

1. **Phased Approach**: The weekly breakdown creates natural checkpoints and deliverables
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Good division of labor between LE and C-Dev
3. **Technical Focus**: Prioritizes core functionality over unnecessary features
4. **Realistic Scope**: Targets a specific persona and limited feature set
5. **Built-in Testing**: Includes pilot user testing before the ACST presentation

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### Week 1: Infra & First Scrape
- **Day 2**: Consider adding a task to define content chunking strategy (1-2 hours)
- **Day 5**: Add basic error handling and logging for the search API (1 hour)

### Week 2: Chat Endpoint & Course Content
- **Day 8**: Include a task to implement rate limiting for the chat API (1 hour)
- **Day 11**: Consider creating a template for the MDX course file to ensure consistency

### Week 3: Next.js Portal & Course Route
- **Day 15**: Add configuration of analytics tracking (1 hour)
- **Day 19**: Include a task to implement basic user feedback collection (1-2 hours)

### Week 4: Pilot, Polish & Launch
- **Day 22**: Add browser compatibility testing (1 hour)
- **Day 24**: Create a simple dashboard for monitoring pilot usage (2 hours)
- **Day 29**: Prepare a one-page summary of pilot user feedback for the ACST presentation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scraping challenges | Medium | High | Have fallback manual content extraction plan |
| API rate limits | Medium | Medium | Implement caching and request batching |
| Contract developer availability | Low | High | Identify backup resources or critical tasks for LE to cover |
| Pilot user engagement | Medium | Medium | Prepare guided testing scenarios for pilot users |
| Performance issues | Low | Medium | Include performance testing before pilot launch |

## Project Management Recommendations

1. **Daily Stand-ups**: Brief 15-minute check-ins with the development team
2. **End-of-Week Reviews**: Assess progress against plan and adjust as needed
3. **Documentation**: Maintain a simple project wiki for technical decisions
4. **Issue Tracking**: Use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests
5. **Communication Plan**: Establish regular updates to stakeholders

## Budget Monitoring

The contract developer estimate of $5-6K for approximately 60 hours seems reasonable. I recommend:
- Setting up time tracking from day one
- Creating weekly budget check-ins
- Establishing clear approval process for any scope changes

## Post-MVP Considerations

While focusing on the MVP, keep these items in mind for discussion with ACST:
1. Content ownership and usage rights
2. Potential integration points with official ACST systems
3. Scaling strategy for additional personas
4. Maintenance and update processes

## Conclusion

This is a well-crafted, realistic plan for delivering a valuable MVP within 30 days. The focus on a specific persona (Events & Groups Coordinator) and limited feature set will allow you to demonstrate clear value to ACST while maintaining a manageable scope.

The plan balances technical implementation with user experience considerations and includes appropriate time for testing and refinement before the final presentation.

Would you like me to help with any specific aspects of the project management, such as creating a more detailed tracking system, developing a risk management plan, or preparing materials for the ACST presentation?
