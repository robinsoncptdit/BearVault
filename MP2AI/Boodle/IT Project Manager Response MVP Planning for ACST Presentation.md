# IT Project Manager Response: MVP Planning for ACST Presentation

Thank you for providing those clarifications, Chuck. This information helps us refine the project approach for your May 21, 2025 presentation to ACST.

## Timeline Alignment

With the presentation date of May 21, 2025, we have significant lead time to prepare. This allows us to:

1. **Execute the 30-day MVP plan** well ahead of the presentation date
2. **Gather meaningful pilot user feedback** to strengthen the demonstration
3. **Refine the solution** based on initial usage data
4. **Prepare compelling presentation materials** that highlight the business case

I recommend scheduling the 30-day development sprint to conclude approximately 2-3 months before the presentation date. This provides buffer time for refinements and ensures a stable product for demonstration.

## Persona Focus Confirmation

The Groups and Events Coordinator persona is an excellent choice for the MVP because:

- This role typically has frequent, hands-on interaction with Ministry Platform
- Event management involves multiple system features, showcasing broader capabilities
- Coordinators often face time constraints that make efficient knowledge access valuable
- This role exists across most parishes, making the solution widely applicable

## Demonstration Strategy

Since you want to keep the focus on the end goal of the product rather than specific pain points, I recommend structuring the demonstration to show:

1. **Efficiency gains** - How quickly a coordinator can find relevant information
2. **Contextual learning** - How the micro-course provides role-specific guidance
3. **Self-service capability** - How the chat widget reduces dependency on support
4. **Scalability potential** - How the approach could extend to other personas

## ACST Funding Strategy

To position this effectively for potential seed funding from ACST, I recommend:

1. **Prepare ROI metrics** showing:
   - Estimated reduction in support tickets
   - Time savings for end users
   - Improved onboarding efficiency
   - Enhanced user satisfaction

2. **Develop a partnership narrative** that emphasizes:
   - How this enhances ACST's product value proposition
   - The potential for wider deployment across their customer base
   - A collaborative approach to knowledge management
   - Shared benefits in customer success and satisfaction

3. **Create a funding proposal** outlining:
   - Specific funding requirements
   - Development milestones and deliverables
   - Success metrics and evaluation criteria
   - Timeline for expanded implementation

## Project Management Recommendations

Based on these clarifications, I recommend these adjustments to the project approach:

1. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add detailed tracking of Groups and Events Coordinator workflows
   - Document specific Ministry Platform features most relevant to this persona
   - Create user stories focused on this persona's needs

2. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - Implement targeted feedback collection from pilot users who are Groups and Events Coordinators
   - Create a simple dashboard showing usage patterns and common queries
   - Prepare anonymized feedback summaries for the ACST presentation

3. **Presentation Preparation**
   - Allocate time for creating professional presentation materials
   - Prepare a demonstration script highlighting key capabilities
   - Develop a one-page executive summary for ACST leadership
   - Create a brief video showcasing the solution in action

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize the 30-day MVP plan** with any adjustments based on these clarifications
2. **Establish the project kickoff date** working backward from the presentation date
3. **Identify pilot users** who match the Groups and Events Coordinator persona
4. **Begin documenting specific workflows** for this persona to inform development
5. **Create a presentation outline** for the ACST meeting

Would you like me to help with any specific aspects of these recommendations, such as developing the ROI metrics, creating a funding proposal template, or establishing a pilot user feedback framework?
