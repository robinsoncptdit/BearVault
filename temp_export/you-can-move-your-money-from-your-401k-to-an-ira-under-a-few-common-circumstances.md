# You can move your money from your 401(k) to an IRA under a few common circumstances:

### âœ… After Leaving Your Job (Most Common)
	* 	**When**: Anytime after you leave the employer who sponsored the 401(k).
	* 	**How**: This is usually done through a **direct rollover**, where the 401(k) provider sends the money directly to your IRA custodian (no taxes withheld).

### âœ… At Age 59Â½ or Older
	* 	**When**: If youâ€™re still working but over **59Â½**, some plans allow whatâ€™s called an **in-service rollover**.
	* 	**How**: Check with your 401(k) plan administrator. Not all plans allow it.

### âœ… At Retirement or Termination
	* 	Once you retire or are terminated, you can roll over the full amount.

### ðŸš« While Still Employed and Under 59Â½
	* 	Generally, **you canâ€™t move funds to an IRA** while youâ€™re still employed and under 59Â½, unless your plan allows for in-service distributions (which is rare before that age).

### Tips:
	* 	A **direct rollover** avoids taxes and penalties. The funds go straight from the 401(k) to the IRA.
	* 	If you do an **indirect rollover** (you receive the check), the IRS withholds **20%**, and you must deposit the full amount (including that 20%) into the IRA within **60 days** to avoid taxes and penalties.
